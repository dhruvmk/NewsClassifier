# NewsClassifier
This project attempts to find a machine learning-based solution to fake news detection

The data was known to have a lower variance based on previous tests, so I used a Stochastic Gradient Descent model to fit the data accurately. The algorithm calculated a partial derivative at each step to optimize the parameters.
